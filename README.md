Topic: Speaker Diarization

Speaker diarization is the process of automatically determining “who spoke when” in an audio recording.

It involves:

Segmenting the audio into distinct chunks where each chunk contains speech from only one speaker.

Clustering those chunks so that all segments from the same speaker are assigned the same label (e.g., Speaker 1, Speaker 2).

Producing a timeline showing when each speaker talked.

It’s used in things like:

Transcribing multi-speaker meetings

Organizing interviews or podcasts

Forensics and call center analytics

A simple way to remember it: speech-to-text tells you what was said, while speaker diarization tells you who said it and at what timestamp said.



Diarization Error Rate:18.20%
Initially getting DER=80.21%. After tuning got DER=18.20%. 
As less DER, Model will be good.
